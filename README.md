# HTTPS for `localhost`

A set of scripts to quickly generate a HTTPS certificate for your local development environment.

## How-to

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it:

```
run git clone
cd local-cert-generator
```
2. Run the script to create a root certificate:

```
sh createRootCA.sh
```

3. Add the root certificate we just generated to your list of trusted certificates. This step depends on the operating system you're running:

    - **macOS**: Open Keychain Access and import the root certificate to your System keychain. Then mark the certificate as trusted.

    - **Linux**: Depending on your Linux distribution, you can use `trust`, `update-ca-certificates` or another command to mark the generated root certificate as trusted.
    - **Windows**: Windows key + R and run certmgr.msc and selecet `Trusted Root Certificatation Authorities--> certificates-->right click-->All Task-->import-->an then follow the instructions

*Note*: You may need to restart your browser to load the newly trusted root certificate correctly.

4. Run the script to create a domain certificate for `localhost`: 

```
sh createSelfSigned.sh
```

5. Move `server.key` and `server.crt` to an accessible location on your server and include them when starting it. In an Express app running on Node.js, you'd do something like this:

```js
var path = require('path')
var fs = require('fs')
var express = require('express')
var https = require('https')

var certOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve('build/cert/server.key')),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve('build/cert/server.crt'))
}

var app = express()

var server = https.createServer(certOptions, app).listen(443)
```
